                <p>Our social skills program utilizes real-time, less structured, group activities which
                allow participants to practice freshly acquired skills with other group members. During
                the practice time, therapists intervene as necessary to help guide the child's efforts
                within these social situations, such as apologizing in a timely manner and using their
                words to facilitate getting their needs met.</p>

                socially!</strong></p>
