                <p>Our social skills groups utilize real-time group activities, such as games,
                activities, or play, allowing participants to practice and generalize freshly acquired
                skills with other group members. During the practice time, therapists intervene as
                necessary to help guide the child, promote pro-social behaviors, and engage in
                appropriate social interactions.</p>

                socially!</strong></p>
