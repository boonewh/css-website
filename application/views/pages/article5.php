                <p><b>October is ADHD Awareness month!</b> Did you know that there are three subtypes of ADHD?</p>

                <p><b>ADHD <i>Hyperactive Type</i></b> is usually what people think of when they think of ADHD - lots of energy, a need to be constantly moving, frequently fidgeting, interrupting others. Some common signs of ADHD hyperactivity include fidgeting, tapping, not being able to sit still for long, blurting out responses, talking excessively, acting without thinking, easily distracted, and feeling like they're always "on the go." Those that fall under this category tend to be easier to spot and is most often diagnosed.</p>

                <p><b>ADHD <i>Inattentive Type</i></b> tends to be the opposite of hyperactive types. People who experience this type of ADHD are more likely to struggle with focus and memory issues as compared to the hyperactive type. Some common signs of ADHD Inattentive Type include zoning out during conversations, getting easily distracted, daydreaming, frequently misplacing things, having a hard time finishing assignments, becoming bored quickly, and struggling to listen when spoken to. Those that fall under this category are more often overlooked, as the symptoms are not as visible.</p>

                <p><b>ADHD <i>Combined Type</i></b> is some combination of the hyperactive and inattentive type and can vary from person to person. To meet this criteria, you need at least five or more symptoms of the inattentive type and at least five or more symptoms of the hyperactive type for at least 6 months. All three of these subtypes can range from mild to severe.</p>
