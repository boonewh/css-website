                    <p><strong>EMDR</strong>, or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, is a therapy used to help reduce the intensity of traumatic memories and negative beliefs by experiencing bilateral stimulation, typically through eye movement, while briefly thinking about the traumatic memory.</p>
                    
                    <p>During an EMDR session, individuals are taught specific back-and-forth eye movements, while following the therapist's guidance to explore traumatic thoughts, images, or events that emerge in their minds and challenge the negative beliefs attached to them. Through time and training, this process helps the brain to reprocess the traumatic events so that feelings and beliefs associated with it are less intense and less painful.</p>
                    
                    <p>In contrast to conventional psychotherapy approaches, individuals undergoing EMDR therapy do not delve extensively into discussing their traumatic experiences. EMDR can be a helpful tool in healing trauma.</p>
