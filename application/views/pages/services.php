                        Adult services at the Center for Social Success are short-term and solution-focused. We use a variety of formats such as individual therapy, family therapy, marital therapy, and bio-feedback.  Individual therapy can focus on anger, anxiety, depression, family of origin, dating, marriage, divorce, grief, ADHD, life-transitions or any topic that a person wants to pursue.Through discussion we are able to identify new directions to promote thought and behavior change.</p>

                        <p> Biofeedback helps individuals to gain awareness of the close mind-body connection to problems such as stress, anxiety, anger, and pain.  Couples can work together on pre-marital or marital counseling to explore and strengthen their relationship or address specific problems.  When there is sufficient interest, we can also do groups on special topics such as ADHD adult issues or parenting issues. Our counselors are trained to help adults solve their own problems in more positive and productive ways.

                        Child, teen, and family therapy services provide practical, new strategies to solve old problems through the use of play therapy, sibling therapy, social skills groups, home visits, school consultations, bullying interventions, parent education, and positive home behavior plans.  Many different therapy formats are offered, including:  individual (play therapy or talking therapy, depending on the child’s age), sibling, peer group, parent training, and family therapy. Individual therapy with a very young child is provided through play to address issues like anger, anxiety, and divorce. Talk therapy is incorporated when the child is old enough to express their feelings in words as well as actions. Both types of therapy are designed to help a child express his or her feelings and learn to deal with difficult situations in more healthy and respectful ways.</p>

                        <p> Sibling therapy is used when there is excessive conflict between brothers and sisters. Each child is given the opportunity to express their frustration regarding specific behaviors of their brothers/sisters and each is helped to see the others point of view.  They are then guided to solve their problems in a more positive way. Peer groups are used to address common problems — like divorce or adoption — or facilitate friendship making. In the social skills groups, challenges like starting conversations, picking up on social cues, breaking into new groups, solving conflicts, rebuilding reputations, and dealing with teasing/bullying are commonly discussed. Parent training is used to help parents better understand their child’s personality style, learning and attention problems, and reasons for acting out as well as to teach new, positive ways to most effectively address issues with family, friends, and teachers.

                        Our animal assisted therapy program at the Center for Social Success utilizes small breed, hypo-allergenic, non-shedding puppies to teach, calm, and motivate our clients. This is only one of the ways we teach social skills while at the same time making therapy fun and exciting! Animals can often make an instant connection with children when adults can’t. They engage children in the therapy process in a very non-threatening way and help to overcome resistance to engaging in the therapy process.

                        <p> The puppies are also used as a play reward after the child  talks about difficulties at home and school and discusses new ways to solve problems.  Puppies can’t talk– so they also help us to teach children how to pick up on non-verbal cues as well as how to correctly  interpret body language.  Our puppies would love to help your child deal with feelings and resolve problems, including communication difficulties, fears, worries, anger, depression, parental separation and divorce, bullying, behavior problems, trauma and abuse.

                        Social skills groups are the best way to help children make and keep friends and deal with teasing. They are also a great source of support and encouragement to children who feel socially isolated or rejected by their peers. When peer relationships are the primary area of difficulty, group therapy is the most effective format. </p>

                        <p>We can “teach” social skills in individual therapy; however, the child must “practice” using the skills with peers in order to integrate the knowledge into real life situations.  Generalization of the skills to real life settings is the goal, but this can be especially hard to do when strong emotions get in the way. Our social skills groups teach the acquisition of skills and also focus on performance.
