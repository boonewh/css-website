                    <h2>PCIT (Parent-Child Interaction Therapy)</h2>
                    <p>Parent-Child Interaction Therapy is an evidence-based program used with
                    children with behavioral problems for parents and children together.
                    PCIT involves "coaching" sessions where you and your child engage in play in a
                    playroom. The therapist observes your interactions and offers real-time coaching
                    on the skills you are acquiring to manage your child's behavior.</p>
                    <p>The PCIT process consists of two phases. The initial phase focuses on the
                    parent and child relationship. This phase of PCIT focuses on enhancing your
                    relationship with your child by teaching you basic play therapy techniques in
                    order to effectively and positively interact with your child. These skills aim to
                    create a sense of calmness in your child, foster a secure parent-child
                    relationship, and enhance self-esteem. Some goals of this phase include
                    increasing your childâ€™s attention span, fostering positive attachments and
                    interactions with you, and increasing pro-social behaviors.</p>
                    <p>The next phase of the therapy aims to empower you to handle your child's most
                    difficult behaviors with confidence, composure, and consistency. During this
                    phase, you'll gain insights into effective strategies for guiding your child to
                    accept limits, follow instructions and house rules, and exhibit appropriate
                    behavior in public. Some goals of this phase include increasing minding and
                    compliance, and effective limit setting.</p>

                    <h2>Sibling Therapy</h2>
                    <p>Are your children constantly fighting with each other? Sibling therapy works
                    to change the pattern of negative interactions between siblings. In our unique
                    sibling therapy sessions, we use cognitive-behavioral techniques to identify
                    problematic areas and behaviors, establish and target behavioral goals, and
                    increase positive interactions between siblings. Parents are also included in
                    this process to help follow through at home by implementing positive behavior
                    plans targeted to increasing positive sibling interactions.</p>

                    <h2>Couples Therapy</h2>
                    <p>Couples therapy is a form of therapy designed to help improve relationships.
                    Couples therapy offers a safe space for addressing an array of relationship
                    issues, including communication, trust, emotional intimacy, and parenting
                    differences. During these sessions, couples have the opportunity to establish
                    goals for their relationship and learn strategies to help achieve their goals,
                    decreasing areas of conflict and increasing positive interactions.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're currently navigating obstacles or simply looking to enhance
                    family bonds, our experienced team is ready to help you foster understanding,
                    resilience, and positive change. Our sessions often take the form of traditional
                    talk therapy, providing a supportive environment for open communication.
                    Additionally, for a unique and immersive experience, sessions can also take
                    place in our specially designed sand tray or art rooms.</p>
